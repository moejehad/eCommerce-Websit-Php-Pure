A Palestinian multi-vendor e-commerce platform has been designed and programmed so that everyone can register on the platform as a seller or as a buyer and can activate his account if he is a seller by providing payment points in each governorate. Payment points.

A profile has been programmed for each user with an easy and simple control panel so that he can control all his purchases and sales, modify data, know the balance of his wallet and add a new product.

A complete control and management system has been programmed for the platform so that the manager can follow up on all products, comments, purchases, sales, invoices, subscriptions, and accounts of both types, following up on payment points.
